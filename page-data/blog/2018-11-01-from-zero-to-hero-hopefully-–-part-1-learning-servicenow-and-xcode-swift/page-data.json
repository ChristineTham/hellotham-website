I am 55 years old. Although I have studied computer science at university, and did some software development in my first few years after university, I haven’t really been involved in writing code, or delivering solutions, or being part of IT projects, for over 30 years.</p>\n<p>I do have some experience working in IT organisations, but on the strategy side. I have delivered multiple IT strategies, managed architecture teams, and dabbled in analytics. But my day to day work as a consultant is about governance, operating models, roadmaps, strategies and business cases.</p>\n<p>So my current client has set me two challenges. I am to get in deep and learn new things, and deliver two working prototypes by the end of the year:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a ServiceNow application implementing a simple service request hopefully integrating to SAP, and</li>\n<li>a native iOS app written in Swift and Xcode using the SAP iOS SDK</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To give you an idea of what I need to learn very quickly in a short space of time, the last time I did any software development we were using Unix terminals and writing C code in vi and compiling using make. Lots of things have happened since then. I keep hearing things like object oriented, MVC, IDE, Agile, Scrum, CI/CD, DevOps and they sound great except I don’t have any first hand experience on any of them.</p>\n<p>This will be an occasional series of articles/journal entries on my progress on the journey and what I will encounter, good and bad. I will have a fellow traveller on the journey, a mobile developer with some knowledge of SAP but limited exposure to ServiceNow and Xcode/Swift.</p>\n<p>So far this is what I have done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attended the Now Forum and did some hands on workshops. Registered as a developer on ServiceNow and created a developer instance and going through the learning paths.</li>\n<li>Found some books on the iBooks store on Swift app development, and some courses on iTunes U.</li>\n<li>Started reading the Swift book – wow this is heavy.</li>\n<li>Figured out how to connect ServiceNow and Xcode to my github account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My current thoughts are: it’s exciting, but also daunting. So many things to learn. I may have to do some stuff on the weekend.</p>\n<p>Also, I keep getting distracted – meetings, events, social. Need to find a way to focus.</p>\n<p>I am also a strong extrovert, and find that I lose motivation fast working by myself. I need to find a way to keep motivated by surrounding myself with people, but at the same time not be overly distracted.</p>\n<p>I am reminded that I am pretty much following the footsteps of the archetypical <em>Hero’s Journey</em> by Joseph Campbell, so I will also be comparing my progress against the stages of the journey.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 31, 2018","title":"From Zero to Hero (hopefully) – Part 1 (Learning ServiceNow and Xcode/Swift)","description":"Part 1 of a series of articles about me learning how to code and delivering two prototypes.","tags":["Proof of Concept","technology","Swift","iOS","ServiceNow"],"featuredimage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/reponame/static/3b8aaacfdeb5bfb8096924b8578c5138/54311/zero-1.png","srcSet":"/reponame/static/3b8aaacfdeb5bfb8096924b8578c5138/6ba37/zero-1.png 512w,\n/reponame/static/3b8aaacfdeb5bfb8096924b8578c5138/4e530/zero-1.png 1024w,\n/reponame/static/3b8aaacfdeb5bfb8096924b8578c5138/54311/zero-1.png 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0dcd9ea0-1d6d-5f0a-adfa-13b8e9b1a557"}}}
