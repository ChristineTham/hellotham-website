It was intended as the 32-bit successor to the PDP-11 with virtual memory addressing.</p>\n<p>The VAX-11/780 was widely believed to be the world’s most powerful mini-computer when it was first introduced, with performance comparable to the IBM System/360 which executed 1 million instructions per second (1 MIPS). Many people then subsequently referred to it as a 1 MIPS machine (even though apparently the actual number of instructions it could execute in 1 second was lower). For many years, it was a standard for system benchmarking, and other systems were reported as<em>x</em>times the speed of the original VAX 11/780 (where<em>x</em>was typically a lot less than 1 for home computers and faster than 1 for high end machines).</p>\n<p>An interesting note: the Raspberry Pi 3 (a US$35 “toy” computer) has a clock speed of 1.2GHz, and hence it is hundreds, possibly thousand times faster than the original VAX-11/780, and tens of times faster than the most powerful VAX ever built (the 9000 series, of which very few were ever produced) – even on just a single core, and the Pi 3 has 4 cores.</p>\n<p>When I was in university, I was surrounded by VAXs (or, as some prefer,<em>vaxen</em>). The maths department was using it to teach undergraduate students (we were actually using real teletype machines to do our assignments), Physics also had several which weren’t accessible to undergrads, and the Computer Science department had the luxury of 2 of them, one for staff and one for students. The one for students was running a tuned version of Unix 32V and could support hundreds of physical terminals, and the staff version had a whopping 8MB of physical memory and was upgraded to the latest version of Research Unix (8th edition).</p>\n<p>In my last year at university, I was given access to the staff VAX, and was even experimenting with some of the new tools (such as the sam editor) on a Blit terminal (the university could only afford a handful) which evolved to be part of Plan 9 from Bell Labs.</p>\n<p>But most of all, I remember some happy memories playing Infocom text adventures with the late, great<a href=\"http://shand.pagesperso-orange.fr/jjm/\">John Mackin</a>in his office late at night. We were using a very early version of the Infocom Task Force interpreter (I was loosely affiliated with the Infocom Task Force – actually, the members were my friends – and not proud to admit that I contributed to MS-DOS port as I was one of the few people that owned an IBM PC XT which I was using for my thesis). I remember one late night when we solved<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lurking_Horror\">Lurking Horror</a>(and John yelled out one of the loudest “SCORE!!!” I have ever heard from him) – those of you who have played Lurking Horror will realise how self-referential the game was to the conditions in which we played it. After that, John and I celebrated by John playing one of his prized possessions – a rare Japanese LP pressing of Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon.</p>\n<h3>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</h3>\n<p>Although ironically I have never actually used BSD on a VAX, it also had a profound impact on my life, and arguably BSD was the operating system that created the Internet as we know it today. For years,<a href=\"http://ucbvax.berkeley.edu/passing-of-ucbvax.txt\">ucbvax</a>was one of the primary relays for UUCP carrying mail and USENET traffic. The Berkeley TCP/IP networking stack ended up being used in many other operating systems (including Linux and Windows pre NT).</p>\n<p>BSD started off as a “West Coast” or “Californian” version of Unix, and it originated in the Computer Science Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) after Ken Thompson spent a year there as a visiting professor.</p>\n<p>If Unix V7 can be considered the “pure” or “austere” form of Unix, then BSD was the colourful, sugary, full-flavoured version of it – it was the equivalent of an ice cream sundae with lots of toppings and V7 was the wafer. Many of the things that we take for granted today as part of the backbone of the Internet was developed for BSD, such as the socket interface, sendmail, the domain name service … BSD also beefed up Unix to be more than a “toy” or research system and updated it to support “modern” video display terminals. Virtual memory, job control, the Fast File System, the lp spooler, long file names, the ex and vi editors … BSD “completed” Unix to the form that it is today. Nearly all operating systems today have been either directly or indirectly influenced by BSD. These days, I still use vi as my preferred text editor for small tasks when I am in the shell.</p>\n<p>For me, BSD was also responsible the loss of a significant portion of my youth – countless hours spent trying to play the game of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29\">rogue</a>. Not many know this, but rogue was initially written as a showcase of the termcap and curses libraries, which became the backbone for most Unix screen oriented applications.</p>\n<p>Many commercial Unix implementations were originally based on BSD. In my first job after leaving university, I was using Sun workstations running SunOS in a stockbroker, then we moved to HP-UX, AIX … all originally BSD based. Most notably, Apple’s operating systems (watchOS, tvOS, iOS and Mac OS X) are all derived from Darwin, which was an attempt to merge Mach with elements from BSD, and OS X still contains most of the BSD user space tools.</p>\n<h3>Emulating 4.3BSDQuasijarus0c on a MicroVAX</h3>\n<p>For the purposes of our trip back in time, I have chosen the Quasijarus fork of 4.3BSDTahoe – the last pure distribution of BSD before it was butchered to make it POSIX compliant. Quasijarus was an attempt in the mid-2000s to update it for some “modern” hardware, including the MicroVAX.</p>\n<p>This can be downloaded and uncompressed:</p>\n<pre><code>wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsd42/files/Install%20tapes/4.3%20BSD%20Quasijarus%200c/4.3BSD-Quasijarus0c.tap.bz2/download -O quasijarus.tap.bz2\nbunzip2 quasijarus.tap.bz2\n</code></pre>\n<p>The standard simh package distributed with the Raspbian operating system on the Raspberry Pi is an older version with no networking support, so we grab the latest working copy of simh:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/simh/simh\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also install a number of additional packages for networking support:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev bridge-utils uml-utilities libvdeplug2-dev vde2 libsdl2-dev\nsd simh; make -j4\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now make a coffee because the Pi 3 is not going to be a fast compiling machine compared to a Macbook.</p>\n<p>Note: some of the steps in the following guide were inspired and derived from the following two articles which I consulted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tavi.co.uk/unixhistory/quasijarus.html\">unixhistory Quasijarus page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/qu1j0t3/simh-networking-linux-howto\">smh networking how to (qu1j0t3)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stage 1: Restoring the mini root filesystem</h3>\n<p>Once the binaries are built, we can start the simulator with the RA82 disk and TQK50/TK50 tape drive, but all other devices disabled (via a boot.ini configuration file for the simulator):</p>\n<pre><code>cd ..\ncat > boot.ini\n; Disable devices we will not be using.\nset cr disable\nset dz disable\nset lpt disable\nset rl disable\nset rq1 disable\nset rq2 disable\nset rq3 disable\nset tq1 disable\nset tq2 disable\nset tq3 disable\nset ts disable\nset xq disable\n; Attach the disk image\nset rq0 ra82\nattach rq0 ra82.dsk\n; Attach the tape image\nattach tq0 quastape.tap\nset tq0 locked\n; Attach the NVRAM file\nattach nvr nvram.bin\n; Set 7 bits on the terminal\nset tti 7b\nset tto 7b\n; Boot the CPU.\nboot cpu\n\nsimh/BIN/vax boot.ini\nMicroVAX 3900 simulator V4.0-0 Beta git commit id: 60439625\nRQ0: creating new file\nNVR: creating new file\nNVR: buffering file in memory\nLoading boot code from internal ka655x.bin\nKA655-B V5.3, VMB 2.7\n1) Dansk\n2) Deutsch (Deutschland/�sterreich)\n3) Deutsch (Schweiz)\n4) English (United Kingdom)\n5) English (United States/Canada)\n6) Espa�ol\n7) Fran�ais (Canada)\n8) Fran�ais (France/Belgique)\n9) Fran�ais (Suisse)\n10) Italiano\n11) Nederlands\n12) Norsk\n13) Portugu�s\n14) Suomi\n15) Svenska\n(1..15): 5\nPerforming normal system tests.\n40..39..38..37..36..35..34..33..32..31..30..29..28..27..26..25..\n24..23..22..21..20..19..18..17..16..15..14..13..12..11..10..09..\n08..07..06..05..04..03..\nTests completed.   >>>boot mua0\n(BOOT/R5:0 MUA0   2..\n-MUA0\n1..0.. =copy\ncpu: uVAX 3000\nFrom: tms(0,1)\nTo: ra(0,1)\nra0: unlabeled\nCopy completed: 308 records copied\n= \n</code></pre>\n<h3>Stage 2: Creating and restoring the full root filesystem</h3>\n<p>Now we boot up the miniroot environment and use it to create and restore the full root filesystem:</p>\n<pre><code>=boot\ncpu: uVAX 3000Boot\n: ra(0,1)vmunix\nra0: unlabeled\n326312+104440+130352 start 0x23b8\n4.3 BSD Quasijarus UNIX #3: Sat Feb 14 20:31:03 PST 2004\nroot@luthien.Harhan.ORG:/nbsd/usr/src/sys/GENERIC\nreal mem = 16744448\nSYSPTSIZE limits number of buffers to 112\navail mem = 14920704\nusing 112 buffers containing 917504 bytes of memory\nMicroVAX 3000, ucode rev 6\ntmscp0 at uba0 csr 174500 vec 774, ipl 15\ntms0 at tmscp0 slave 0\nuda0 at uba0 csr 172150 vec 770, ipl 15\nuda0: version 3 model 3\nuda0: DMA burst size set to 4\nra0 at uda0 slave 0: no disk label: ra82, size = 1216665 sectors\nroot device?

First, we need to determine the current networking parameters:</p>\n<pre><code>ifconfig eth0\neth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr b8:27:eb:b1:3d:ff\ninet addr:192.168.0.235 Bcast:192.168.0.255 Mask:255.255.255.0\ninet6 addr: fe80::6973:1a1a:a317:33a0/64 Scope:Link\nUP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1\nRX packets:134170 errors:0 dropped:1544 overruns:0 frame:0\nTX packets:7160 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\ncollisions:0 txqueuelen:1000\nRX bytes:29582652 (28.2 MiB) TX bytes:2495187 (2.3 MiB)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above are the values for my system (For the purposes of simplicity, I have assigned a static IP address to the eth0 interface by mapping the MAC address to an IP address in my router – an Apple Time Capsule). Now we configure the bridge:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo tunctl -t tap0 -u pi\nSet 'tap0' persistent and owned by uid 1000\nsudo brctl addbr br0\nsudo brctl addif br0 eth0\nsudo brctl setfd br0 0\nsudo ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0\nsudo ifconfig br0 192.168.0.235 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255\nsudo brctl addif br0 tap0\nsudo ifconfig tap0 0.0.0.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note I did not set up a default gateway because I already have one (because my wlan0 interface is also active and connected to the same network). However, if you are using eth0 as your only interface, you may want to do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>route -n</code></strong><br>\n<em>[before you do the steps above and write down your current default gateway – which is usually the address of your router]</em></li>\n<li><strong><code>sudo route add -net 0.0.0.0/0 gw</code></strong><br>\n<em>[IP address of your gateway]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stage 5: Multi-user boot and set up networking</h3>\n<p>We create a default initialisation file called vax.ini (which the vax simulator will automatically execute if it finds it). This enables the DZV11 terminal multiplexor and connect it to port 8023, as well as the DEQNA Ethernet controller connected to the tap0 interface. We also enable autoboot from the default device (DUAO:)</p>\n<pre><code>cat > vax.ini\n; Disable devices we are not using.\nset cr disable\nset lpt disable\nset rl disable\nset rq1 disable\nset rq2 disable\nset rq3 disable\nset tq1 disable\nset tq2 disable\nset tq3 disable\nset ts disable\n; Enable the DZ-11 serial lines on port 8023.\nset dz enable\nattach dz 8023\nset dz lines=8\nset dz 7b\n; Attach the Ethernet interface\nset xq enable\nset xq type=deqna\nattach xq0 tap:tap0\n; Attach the disk image\nset rq0 ra82\nattach rq0 ra82.dsk\n; Attach the NVRAM file\nattach nvr nvram.bin\n; Set 7 bits on the terminal\nset tti 7b\nset tto 7b\n; CPU idle time tuning\nset cpu idle=quasijarus\n; Set Boot and Diagnostic Register (BDR) to 0 to enable autoboot to default dev\n; Actually the only important bit is bit 7 (Break Enable on the CPU panel)\ndeposit bdr 0\n; Boot the CPU.\nboot cpu\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we commence the first boot of 4.3BSD which will do a filesystem check (fsck) of all filesystems:</p>\n<pre><code>simh/BIN/vax\nMicroVAX 3900 simulator V4.0-0 Beta git commit id: 60439625\nListening on port 8023\nlibpcap version 1.6.2\nEth: opened OS device tap0\nNVR: buffering file in memory\nLoading boot code from internal ka655x.bin\nKA655-B V5.3, VMB 2.7\nPerforming normal system tests.\n40..39..38..37..36..35..34..33..32..31..30..29..28..27..26..25..\n24..23..22..21..20..19..18..17..16..15..14..13..12..11..10..09..\n08..07..06..05..04..03..\nTests completed.\nLoading system software.\n(BOOT/R5:0 DUA0     2..\n-DUA0\n1..0.. loading boot Boot\n: /vmunix\n326312+104440+130352 start 0x23b8\n4.3 BSD Quasijarus UNIX #3: Sat Feb 14 20:31:03 PST 2004\nroot@luthien.Harhan.ORG:/nbsd/usr/src/sys/GENERIC\nreal mem = 16744448\nSYSPTSIZE limits number of buffers to 112\navail mem = 14920704\nusing 112 buffers containing 917504 bytes of memory\nMicroVAX 3000, ucode rev 6\ntmscp0 at uba0 csr 174500 vec 774, ipl 15\ntms0 at tmscp0 slave 0\nuda0 at uba0 csr 172150 vec 770, ipl 15\nuda0: version 3 model 3\nuda0: DMA burst size set to 4\nra0 at uda0 slave 0: ra82, size = 1216665 sectors\ndz0 at uba0 csr 160100 vec 300, ipl 17\ndz1 at uba0 csr 160110 vec 310, ipl 17\nqe0 at uba0 csr 174440 vec 764, ipl 14\nqe0: deqna, hardware address 08:00:2b:aa:bb:cc\nChanging root device to ra0a\nAutomatic reboot in progress...\nTue Apr 20 02:31:48 PDT 2004\n/dev/ra0a: 451 files, 5228 used, 1865 free (17 frags, 231 blocks, 0.2% fragmentation)\n/dev/rra0g: 12316 files, 71689 used, 323162 free (426 frags, 40342 blocks, 0.1% fragmentation)\n/dev/rra0h: 1 files, 1 used, 136503 free (15 frags, 17061 blocks, 0.0% fragmentation)\nTue Apr 20 02:32:20 PDT 2004\nchecking quotas: done.\nstarting system logger preserving editor files\nclearing /tmp\nstandard daemons: update cron accounting.\nstarting network daemons: routedApr 20 02:32:23 myname named[78]: /etc/named.boot: No such file or directory\nnamed inetd printer.\nstarting local daemons: sendmail.\nTue Apr 20 02:32:26 PDT 2004\n4.3 BSD UNIX (myname.my.domain) (console) login: \n</code></pre>\n<p>We then login as root (no password), then set the terminal to xterms (assuming that we are running the Pi under X graphical environment), allowing us to then run vi:</p>\n<pre><code>4.3 BSD UNIX (myname.my.domain) (console)login: root\nLast login: Tue Apr 20 02:28:21 on console\nApr 20 02:33:47 myname login: ROOT LOGIN console\n4.3 BSD Quasijarus UNIX #3: Sat Feb 14 20:31:03 PST 2004   Welcome to UNIX! erase ^?, kill ^U, intr ^C\n# TERM=xterms\n# export TERM\n# vi /etc/networks \n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if you prefer the old school way (I am calling my home network home-net):</p>\n<pre><code>cat > /etc/networks\nhome-net 255.255.255 HOME network\n</code></pre>\n<p>My /etc/hosts file is quite minimal, I just insert my hostname (uvaxquas) and the gateway (router):</p>\n<pre><code>cat > /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1 localhost\n# HOME network\n192.168.0.1 router\n192.168.0.235 uvaxquas\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next up is /etc/netstart, which I edited using vi (bold text indicate what I changed in that file):</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/sh -\n#\n# @(#)netstart 1.1 (Berkeley) 1/10/99routedflags=-q\nrwhod=NO   # uvaxquas is my symbolic name\n# home-net is specified in /etc/networks\n#\nhostname=uvaxquas\nhostname $hostname # ifconfig imp0 inet $hostname\n# ifconfig de0 inet $hostname netmask my-netmask\nifconfig qe0 inet $hostname netmask home-net ifconfig lo0 inet localhost\nroute add $hostname localhost 0\nhostid $hostname route add default 192.168.0.1 1 \n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally enable remote name resolution by disabling the named server (comment out the line beginning with named in /etc/rc) and insert the router as the nameserver</p>\n<pre><code>cat > /etc/resolv.conf\nnameserver 192.168.0.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>After reboot, the system should be up and running and can connect to the Internet.
